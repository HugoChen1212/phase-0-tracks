What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML5 sematic tags is to make the page more readable and accessible to people with disabilities.
I think footer is the most useful element for me because I always set my Copyright information in the footer.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser defaults to loading everything in the body from top to bottom
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learn something very cool about sublime in this challenge; I didnâ€™t know we can create our own snippets that is very cool and convenient. Absolutely, I will create more handy snippets at a later date because it will help my typing a lot.

I think the most difficult thing for me in this concept is learning how to create my own snippets because it take me a long time to understand how it work. I think I will create more different snippets that would help me understanding of this concept better.
