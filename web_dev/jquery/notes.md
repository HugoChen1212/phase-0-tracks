First, I think I will spend few time to watch YouTube video, to find out what is JQuery about. Then I will do some resources on Google to find out more information about JQuery like why JQuery is important for web development, and what is the advantage and disadvantage. Also I will learn how to use JQuery. I find out there is a three hours lecture to learn JQuery in Codecademy, and I will spend my time on it. I plant to stop for 5 minutes break in each 30 minutes. I think a breaks is very important because after a breaks I feel my learning process is more efficiency.

When the time is up, I think stop for 5 minutes break in each 30 minutes study with Codecademy, I will my studying is more efficiency, for the learning material of the lecture it say will need about 3 hours study for that, but I just done it within 2 hours.
